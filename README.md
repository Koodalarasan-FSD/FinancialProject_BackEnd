# FinancialProject_BackEnd
  - In my second project, named the Financial Project, I utilized the Django (Python) Framework, MySQL Database, Bootstrap 5 Framework, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
  - This project features a comprehensive dashboard enabling various processes, such as adding(storing) members(Debtors) and facilitating the editing and deletion of member records. User can also add (store) initial transactions and perform corresponding edits and deletions.
  - Furthermore, the dashboard allows the addition(payment) of payments with backend calculations. User can edit and delete payments, with the ability to rollback calculation proceedings on the backend under specific conditions.
  - Additionally, there's a functionality to print payment details and save them as PDF for debtors, providing a convenient way for them to review their payment information.
